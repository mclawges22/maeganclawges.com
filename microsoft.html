    <h1 class="ms-head">Windows User Experience Design</h1>
    
    <h2>Microsoft Explorer Internship</h2>
    <p class="intro">Over the Summer of 2013 I had the opportunity to try out the four core roles in the Windows User Experience
      team: User Experience Designer, Program Manager, Software Developer, Software Developer in Test. It was an awesome experience
      to work closely with people across many teams and roles. I met with people across the company to learn about tools that we
      could use in our project. 
    </p>
    <p>When I arrived at Microsoft in May, my team was about to ship Windows 8.1. I began self-hosting and filing bugs on the
      daily builds, but it was too late to begin developing a feature for 8.1. Therefore, my explorer trio was given the task of
      creating a vision for the next Windows operating system and developing a prototype proof-of-concept to demo to the Windows User
      Experience team.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="ms-dev">"Why aren't there any pictures of my project?"</h4>
    <p class="note">Below I will describe a general overview of what I did and learned in each of the four roles I experienced at
      Microsoft. I cannot show sketches or screenshots from our project, or go into detail about which areas of Windows we were
      focusing on because of Non-Disclosure Agreements. Thank you for understanding.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="ms-head">Program Management</h2>
    <h4 class="ms-dev">Identifying our goals and brainstorming solutions</h4>
    <p>I began my work as a PM by familiarizing myself with the Windows 8.1 operating system. I assessed the strengths and weaknesses.
      By pinpointing looked for holes in available features, I began brainstorming ways to make user scenarios more efficient in Windows.
      The next three weeks were spent imagining the potential of a new Windows ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>From there I worked with the other two explorer interns to enumerate our goals for our prototype of the next Windows operating
      system. I researched the existing Windows 8.1 framework and API that we could use to simulate the experience we were envisioning.
      In addition, we also took note of what would need to be built by the Windows team in the future to fully implement our project.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="ms-dev">I wrote a full-feature design specification describing:</h4>
    <ul class="ms-pm">
        <li>the value of the project </li>
        <li>the goals and assumptions</li>
        <li>an assessment of the competitive landscape of the project</li>
        <li>the scenarios that the project would cover</li>
        <li>prioritizing specific features</li>
        <li>early sketches and design iterations</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 class="ms-dev">Scoping and Prioritizing Features</h4>
    <p>I began my work as a program manager with an open mind and a wide vision. However, towards the end of the planning phase I
      learned to scope the project down to what could be developed by our 3-person team in 4-5 weeks. This meant prioritizing the
      features that were essential for the success of the project and which ones could be built with existing framework and easily
      demoed on a small scale. However, the work I did in planning the full set of features will be very helpful to my team when
      they begin working on Windows Next.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="ms-head">Software Development</h2>
    <h4 class="ms-dev">Code Windows 8.1 app in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h4>
    <p>We divided the development of our project between the three of us. One girl was working in PC Settings and one was working with
      third-party APIs to hydrate the backend with data. I was in charge of developing the user interface for our project, which was
      going to come to life in a Windows 8.1 app. I built the app from scratch in HTML, CSS and JavaScript using the WinRT platform.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="ms-dev">Iterate on design ideas for the future user experience of Windows</h4>
    <p>Normally the Windows User Experience designers produce high fidelity comps of the UI in Illustrator, which they hand off to
      the developers to bring to life in code. However, I got to design the UI on my own because we didn't have a designated designer
      on our Explorer Intern trio. I worked with the user experience designers to iterate on the current Windows design principles
      and style to look at designs for the future of Windows and bring them to life in my app. I really enjoyed being able to
      crossover between the design and development roles to explore design ideas by prototyping in code. It was also really
      interesting to experience the design process in a larger corporation.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="ms-dev">Design the backend structure for the data displayed in the UI</h4>
    <p>In addition to designing the user interface I worked very closely with my teammate who was working with the APIs. I built a
      skeleton for the backend of the app so that she would know how to organize the data structure to provided the necessary information
      in a user-friendly format. It was challenging to write code that would allow the UI to adjust dynamically as the data hydrated the app.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="ms-head">Software Testing</h2>
    <p>At Microsoft Software Developers in Test (SDETs) are responsible for enumerating scenarios in which the product could break
      or block the user from completing his or her task and figuring out how to simulate these situations to ensure that the software
      is designed to accomodate them. They use basic unit tests and much more complex automated and manual testing procedures to test
      the entire Windows operating System. Even though I do not intend to focus my career on testing, I learned a lot about how to assess
      a project's potential weaknesses. The Windows user experience testers were especially focused on thinking critically about
      situations in which the user may be confused, impatient, or unable to complete their task.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="ms-dev">Some fascinating User Experience Test scenarios I learned about:</h4>
    <ul class="ms-test">
        <li><strong>Language -</strong> The same words can mean different things in various cultures. For example, a "family" looks
          very different in urban North America than in Asia or Africa. The usefulness of a feature for families might need to be
          described differently in different cultures.</li>
        <li><strong>Loading Content -</strong> Any time the user is waiting, they are wondering what is going on and why they have to wait.
          It is important to explain what is happening and communicate how long it will take. Additionally, an interactive and joyful
          user interface goes a long way in customer satisfaction. </li>
        <li><strong>Disability and Accessibility -</strong> One of Microsoft's original goals was that everyone should have a
          PC. This inherently includes people who are blind, deaf, or have other disabilities. Adjusting the user interface to accomodate
          a variety of disabilities while maintaining its functionality and enjoyability is quite challenging.</li>
    </ul>
