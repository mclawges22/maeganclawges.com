    <h2>An interactive Django project serving and visualizing North Carolina public school data</h2>

    <p class="intro">
      I worked on this project with a couple of other students from the UNC
      Journalism School. A group of videographers asked us to work on a data
      visualization project to accompany
      <a href="http://faultlinesnc.com/">their project</a>
      depicting the issues swirling around the school-to-prison pipeline in
      Durham County, NC. After exploring the available data, we realized that
      focusing merely on Durham County high schools would be ethically risky
      because we didn't have enough data to draw any conclusions. Therefore,
      we decided to take a step back and focus on data for each North Carolina
      school district. The story that we discovered in the correlations is
      fascinating for someone who knows the state as well as people looking for
      more general trends in K-12 education in the U.S. I really enjoyed working
      with my teammates to process and present such a large set of data, which
      was previously hidden from most citizens' line of sight.</p>

    <h2 class="dark-purple">Week One - Exploring public data and choosing our focus</h2>
    <p>We were asked to take on this project four weeks before our
      <a href="http://faultlinesnc.com/">sister project</a>
      would launch. We immediately began researching what data was alrady
      available and in which formats. Our limited time frame made requesting
      additional public data impossible. This limitation eliminated our original
      idea to focus our visualization project on data about each individual
      school in Durham. We discovered a
      <a href="http://www.ncreportcards.org/src/">government site</a>
      with a variety of data about each school district, including academic,
      socio-economic, and disciplinary information. This seemed like a good focus
      to us because it would allow us to reveal trends about different areas of
      the state and correlations between those three types of data.</p>

    <h2 class="dark-purple">Week Two - Building our database and wireframing</h2>
    <p>My teammate worked on converting the data from Access to a PostgreSQL
      database, the ideal tool for the huge amount of data we were processing.
      Meanwhile, I worked with my other teammate on the design of the site. Our
      sister project had a predetermined color palette and style guide that we
      adopted. We had three views of the data that we wanted to visualize - a
      geographic mapping of trends, a detail profile for a county and a tool for
      comparing multiple school districts. We felt a single page experience would
      really enrich the data visualization so we focused on a compact user interface
      with a powerful user flow (definitely not a typical use case for a Django site).
      A visitor would explore the map overview first and then click on district or
      search to explore the details and see the types of data that was available
      and finally, take a look at the difference among the districts they selected.
      See below for our color comps:</p>

    <h2 class="dark-purple">Week Three - Front-end development... oh, and writing our own API</h2>
    <p>After implementing the design in HTML and CSS, I began to focus on the order
      of user interaction and how to provide an intuitive guide to exploring the
      web page. The map implementation was simple enough, but I wanted each of the
      three "sections" of the page to communicate with each other. For example, a
      click on the map would load the selected district in the district profile,
      meanwhile, we needed to keep track of the last three viewed districts because
      they would be featured in the compare section. The user could interact directly
      with the compare tool by selecting districts from the drop-down. I also directly
      implemented all of the data visualization pieces except for the pie charts, for
      which we used <a href="http://highscharts.com">HighCharts</a> to generate them
      dynamically. I began the week with mock data hard-coded into the website because
      my PostgreSQL partner had realized that we needed a REST API so that we wouldn't
      have to reload the page every time the user chose a new school district. For example,
      <a href="http://school-discipline.herokuapp.com/api/districts/680/">http://school-discipline.herokuapp.com/api/districts/680</a>
      serves school district data for Orange County Schools. We just barely got
      the data loading dynamically by the end of the week and realized two things:
      1) sometimes ugly data in the wild breaks your beautiful user-interface, and
      2) when you host your data with a free server...sometimes it takes a really
      long time to load.</p>

    <h2 class="dark-purple">Week Four - Bug fixing and refining the mobile experience</h2>
    <p>We began the week with some definite problems to resolve including writing
      code to cover newly discovered edge cases in the data and adding a visual
      loading experience to let the user know that the program was working and would
      show them awesome things soon. While resolving this we also realized that we
      needed to take a second look at our user experience on mobile because the order
      of exploration that worked so well on desktop browsers wasn't intuitive on
      mobile. First of all, we eliminated the map to provide a more compact view.
      Since the map was no longer acting as the anchor and broad overview of the data,
      we decided to take the user straight to the compare districts experience as an
      overview and introduction. From there we offered the option to drill down into
      a district's details (pages created for each district using a Django template).
