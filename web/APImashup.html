    <h2>An API Mashup</h2>

    <p>I began this project as an individual entry at a hackathon two weeks ago.
      In “Somewhere Over The Rainbow” I create a user interface for people
      researching places they might want to move to or visit. My main goal was
      to bring together data from a variety of sites in a single user interface
      to give the user an overall feel for the city without having to search
      five different sites. Right now you can search for a city and the Google
      GeoCode API will provide the latitude/longitude of the location to the
      Google map API. I also use PHP to access the Twitter search API and stream
      tweets including the hashtag for the city. An iframe loads in the “data”
      tab with statistics about the quality of life and cost of living. Over the
      next week I am going to add an photo stream from the Instagram search API.
      The yellow “home” tab will feature the predicted weather for the selected
      time of year from the Weather Channel’s API as well as a few tweets and
      photos. The final part of the project will involve allowing users to create
      accounts on my server and save their favorite searches to allow them to
      easily track areas of interest. It has been a lot of fun learning to use
      the Google maps/geocode API as well as the other APIs.</p>

    <h2 class="dark-purple">Design Process</h2>
    <p>I began the project with the concept of a large map filling the screen
      with the API data in some sort of overlaid container. I explored a variety
      of designs for organizing the data, such as side tabs, top tabs, separate
      boxes for each type, etc. I also started out with a much more complex UI
      representing the user in the top right corner. Then I realized that the
      user did not really need all those options to achieve the goal so I
      simplified the header. See below for my various iterations from sketching
      to comp and then visit the
      <a href="http://maeganclawges.com/static/final/api.php">current site</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="dark-purple">Final Comp</h2>
    <p>I decided to put the tabs on the top of the data overlay because reading
      sideways felt like it would be too hard on the reader and didn't necessarily
      add to the visual appeal of the map. I also liked the name "Somewhere Over
      The Rainbow" because it lent itself to a lightweight and joyful color scheme
      that tied the page together. This is the design I made in Adobe Illustrator
      before I began to code. I used layers to show different states of the page
      based on different user scenarios. At this stage I discovered another way
      to simplify the UI - through the search flow. I originally planned to
      overlay a window with advanced search options every time the user wanted a
      new search. After adding it to my comp I realized that some of the options
      I was going to offer were not necessary and others could be incorporated at
      different spots in the UI. For example, the time of year selection that
      controls the weather data.</p>
