      <h2>Beginnings</h2>

      <p>I was in college when university hackathons became popular for computer
        science students. I loved meeting new people at the events and learning
        from industry mentors. However, while I was at a hackathon in November
        2013, I noticed that there were far less women than men at the event.
        The gender gap was even larger than what I was used to at school and in industry.
        I started to talk to friends about what was keeping them away. They
        cited small things like womens' restrooms turned coed and reports of sexual
        assault in nap rooms. However, the overwhelming common thread was that they
        didn't consider themselves "hackers," and they were intimidated by an
        environment they didn't feel qualified to compete in.</p>

      <p>A change was needed - women would not start coming to these events until
        they felt like they were welcome. University hackathons desperately needed
        a base of women who felt comfortable inviting their female friends to these
        events. With all of this in mind, I decided to organize a hackathon with
        the purpose of building a community of women who loved to code, learn, and
        solve complex problems with each other. I had just attended my first
        <a href="http://ghc.anitaborg.org/">Grace Hopper Conference</a> and was
        inspired by the female tech community that event was able to bring together (GHC has
        <a href="http://ghc.anitaborg.org/about" target="_blank">tripled in size</a> since 2013).</p>

      <h2>Organizing the first Pearl Hacks</h2>

      <p>Creating a logo and building the website was just the tip of the iceberg.
        For three months I worked to raise money, recruit about 50 mentors from
        over 15 tech companies, and coordinate logistics for the day of the event.
        It was an all-consuming project, but I learned so much about how to organize
        people, communicate ideas, book charter busses, etc. In late March 2014,
        200 college students came from universities as far away as California and
        Illinois to participate in Pearl Hacks in addition to 50 local high school girls.</p>

      <p>It was amazing to see my dream come to life in the eyes of everyone involved.
        One UNC student, who had repeatedly stated that she "wasn't the hackathon type,"
        won the grand prize, an all-expenses-paid trip to the 2014 Grace
        Hopper Celebration. Another girl came up to me after the awards ceremony
        and said that a week earlier she had decided to drop her computer science major,
        but after Pearl Hacks she was determined to stick with it. It turned out that
        these were the first of many inspiring stories about how Pearl Hacks inspired
        women to pursue their passion for engineering and technology.</p>

      <h2>Part 2 - Pearl Hacks 2015</h2>
      <img class="pearl-hacks-logo" src="../images/pearlhacks/yellowgirl.png">
      <p>The second Pearl Hacks doubled to 400 high school and college students,
        plus 100 mentors and volunteers. Students came from 80 colleges in 14 states.
        The best part of this second event was how many participants from 2014 came
        back and brought their friends with them. It took a lot of my time and energy
        to keep Pearl Hacks going, but I think having a consistent director helped
        foster the sense of community for both participants and sponsors.</p>

      <p>In order to scale the event and prepare for my graduation, I trained a
        team of 10 organizers to work on sponsorship, food, transportation and
        mentor/workshop coordination. Five of these organizers are now acting as
        directors of Pearl Hacks 2016 and they have expanded the team to include
        about 30 UNC Women in Computer Science. Before graduating I was honored with the
        <a href="http://cs.unc.edu/news/undergraduate-maegan-clawges-honored-with-university-award-for-the-advancement-of-women/">University Award for the Advancement of Women</a>
        for starting Pearl Hacks. Receiving that award paired with stepping down
        as director of Pearl Hacks still feels like a surreal moment in my life.</p>

      <h2>Expanding the vision and brand</h2>

      <p>The first year, the team that won first place made
        <a href="http://uncviscom.webfactional.com/culture-of-yes">a Django app</a>
        about sexual assault on college campuses. They scraped college newspaper websites to
        collect data about the sexual assault story that was coming together across the country
        (<a href="http://relevant-ideas.herokuapp.com/1">read more on the team's blog</a>).
        Inspired by their project, I created a new category prize for the second year
        called the "Pearl Hacks prize." It encouraged projects focusing on human
        trafficking, sexual assualt, women's issues, and sexual health.

      <p>In addition, the original logo wasn't very versatile for different materials and display
        environments. The goal was something more monochromatic that would work on
        various backgrounds. I also wanted a personable brand that our female participants
        would identify with. Our solution was a silhouette of a girl working on a laptop.
        We incorporated the brand into
        <a href="http://pearlhacks.com/2015/">an interactive website</a> and printed
        shirts in different colors to match.</p>

      <h2>Part 3 - Life as Mentor</h2>

      <p>I have been totally hands-off in organizing the third Pearl Hacks now that
        I'm not a student anymore. I returned for the third Pearl Hacks as a technical
        mentor from Google. In addition to helping with projects I taught a
        <a href="http://github.com/mclawges22/d3-workshop" target="_blank">workshop on D3.js</a>
        and moderated a roundtable discussion on working with and thinking like
        a designer. It was wonderful to see how the event evolved under the new directors.</p>

      <p>The movement that started with Pearl Hacks over two years ago has turned
        into something much bigger than a 500-person event at UNC. Hackathons for
        college-aged women began appearing all over the country in 2015. I have
        advised many of the founders and directors of these events, listed below:</p>
