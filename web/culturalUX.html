      <h2>An international communication research project</h2>

      <p>This is a semester research project for my International Communication
        class in the UNC Journalism School. We could choose any topic that
        related to the class as well as which format would be best for conveying
        our findings. I was first introduced to the conundrum of designing for
        international audiences during my internship at Microsoft. Windows is
        used by 85% of computer users as of July 2013. Obviously they face this
        issue and may or may not be succeeding in tackling it. I was surprised
        to learn how difficult it is for a designer to find conceptual metaphors
        that make sense to people from another culture.</p>

      <img id="culturalUX" src="../images/culturalUXsplash.png">
      <p>I chose to present my project through a website because it would be more
        accessible to the general public than the suggested 16-page paper. I hope
        people will spend more time learning and thinking about this issue. I
        also wanted to include some cool interactive data visualizations for the
        site, including a map of the growth of Internet access from 1990 to 2012
        and a dynamic bar graph tool for comparing cultures in different countries.
        See below for screenshots or
        <a href="http://maeganclawges.com/culturalUXdesign" target="_blank">visit the site</a>.
        Note: This site is not accessible on mobile platforms due to complexity
        of the content and limited time for the school project.</p>

      <p>Over the next couple of weeks I will wrap up my project with case studies
        comparing versions of the McDonalds and Nokia homepages that were designed
        for different cultures. I look forward to analyzing their research and
        seeing which things they changed and which elements remained the same on
        the various sites. I will update this page once it is over with a more
        in-depth report of my process throughout the project. Stay tuned!</p>
