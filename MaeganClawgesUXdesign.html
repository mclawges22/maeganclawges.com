<div style="margin-left:23%;margin-right:23%">
<p>I began college with the Graphic and Interactive Design concentration in the Journalism School because I really enjoyed being visually creative and found that journalism was an awesome medium to use that visual creativity to communicate with people. I quickly realized that computer science was a very important tool in designing for new technology.</p>
<p>In my projects so far I have found that the step between a high fidelity comp and a functional prototype is huge. When I begin to code I almost always realize that things I thought were great in Illustrator arenâ€™t as seamless as I expected and the iteration in that setting really helps me push my projects beyond good graphic design to good interaction design.</p>
<p>I think the Explorer internship is a perfect example. They look for people who are studying computer science, but they place a lot of emphasis on strong communication and teamwork skills as well as being fast learners. I learned these skills through my experience in the journalism school more than in computer science.</p></div>

<p>Powering a Nation is an award-winning project that brings together students from different concentrations in the UNC Journalism School to create interactive storytelling content for the Powering a Nation website to spread awareness and understanding of the many energy issues America faces.

<p style="font-style:italic">Note:  Programmers working on this project before me overlooked compatibility with Internet Explorer, a decision that I had to accept as I joined the team. All links are best viewed on Google Chrome in a large browser window.</p>
<p>I worked with a 12-person team during the spring 2013 semester. Here is an outline of our process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Familiarize ourselves with <a href="http://www.poweringanation.org/">Powering a Nation</a> and our specific project, <a href="http://www.poweringanation.org/water-dev/">100 Gallons</a>.</li>
<li>Look for holes in the existing content and brainstorm new topics.</li>
<li>Conduct external research to flesh out our most intriguing ideas. As an interaction designer, I was focused on the storytelling format and experience. Here is some of my early inspiration:</li>

<li><a href="http://lostworldsfairs.com/atlantis/">http://lostworldsfairs.com/atlantis/</a></li></ul>
<li>Second brainstorm to narrow our focus and synthesize/connect ideas. Interactive and graphic designers work on preliminary sketches for the strongest projects.</li>
<li>Decide to build an interactive page telling the story of a water droplet in the 21st century. The page would feature a parallax animation experience that we hoped would engage the reader in the page.</li>
<li>Delegate work between researchers, writers, videographers, graphic designers, interaction designers, and marketing team.</li>
<li>I used my research and programming background to lead the team in planning a storyboard that would be fluid and functional as a digital experience. It was challenging to integrate everyone's separate ideas into a single seamless web page. You can view our <a href="PoweringaNation/whiteboard_storyboard.png">sketches</a> here.</li>

<li>I worked with two other interaction designers to program the page. One was in charge of the CSS styles for the page. One worked on the accordion at the bottom and the integration of our page into the existing site. I was responsible for the structure of the page itself, meaning the HTML and JavaScript that would produce the parallax effect we wanted to achieve. I loved working on this part of the project because I was able to play such an integral role in the flow of the page; every piece of content went through my hands. I also loved working closely with the designers. I provided them with my sketches and specs for the images we needed and they turned them into a reality.</li></ol>
<p>The finished project can be found at the last dot beneath the 100 Gallons concept video or here: <a href="http://www.poweringanation.org/water-dev/intro/PAN/index.html">Use. Misuse. Abuse.</a> My biggest regret was that we didn't have time or resources to conduct user research throughout our brainstorming and production phases.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p></div>

<h2 style="text-align:center">The Daily Tar Heel - Layout and Graphic Design</h2>
<p>The Daily Tar Heel is one of the top daily student-run newspapers in the country with 38,000 daily web/print views. I work on the Design and Graphics Desk. We are responsible for laying out front and inside pages as well as producing maps, graphics and icons to visually enrich the content. My favorit part of the job is designing larger infographics and working on long-term design projects. We are also working with the multimedia desk to iterate ideas to unite the print and web newspaper experience.</p>

<a href="Daily Tar Heel/PaydayLoanGraphic.png"><img src="Daily Tar Heel/PaydayLoanGraphic.png" width="100%"/></a>
<p>I made this infographic to explain the complex payday laon process in North Carolina and how the proposed legislature might change it. This project was especially challenging because I only had about six hours to complete it. This meant talking to the writer to understand the payday loan process, sketching design ideas, completing the design in Illustrator, and making adjustments based on three editor reviews. To me this project really showcases the critical thinking that a designer must do to visually represent a concept.</p></div>

<a href="Daily Tar Heel/DTH homecoming cover 2012.png"><img src="Daily Tar Heel/DTH homecoming cover 2012.png" width="100%"/></a>
<p>I designed this as the cover of a special Homecoming edition of the Daily Tar Heel. It's purpose was to grab people's attention in the news stand. I wanted both alumni and current students to recognize the graphic of their campus and feel at home. This project was an exploration in using flat shapes to make a "digital" collage. I had a lot of fun overlaying different shades of green with transparency to acheive the look and feel that I envisioned. It was both challenging and intriguing to represent campus landmarks as flat, blockish cartoon images.</p></div>

<p>This is an example of an inside page that I designed. We focus on heirarchy and dominence to highlight the most important stories on the page. I also like to use directional lines and strategic photo placement to guide the reader's eye. We have a very detailed style guide to keep our alignment and fonts consistent.</p></div>
